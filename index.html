    <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
    <p>My name is Kathy and I'm excited to be in this English course for Spring Quarter. I transferred to UW Seattle back in the fall and it has been a chaotic but fun year. Outside of academics, I spend time with my family, listen to music and dance! I've been self taught in hip-hop since middle school and joined a dance crew this year. We focus on traditional Filipino dances such as Pukol and Tinikling, performing for the community while also learning about our cultural roots. I hope for this year to understand more about technology and what it has to offer.</p>
