  <p>Quokkas are small marsupials part of the macropod family. Mostly seen in Western Australia, they initially lived on the mainland and the two main islands like Bald and Rottnest. As the years went by however, climate change and expansion in housing have significantly decreased the population. Living conditions and sources of food have become limited, and resulted in being classified as a threatened species. With  these protected areas alongside the offshore islands, quokkas have been able to thrive and continuously be observed through their interactions with the environment and people.
